# Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Cellular Oxidation States in Breast Cancer Cell Lines

Hypoxia, low oxygen availability, is a key feature of tumor biology, driving cancer cells toward more aggressive, treatment-resistant behavior. Being able to identify whether a cell is in hypoxic or normoxic conditions is therefore essential for understanding cancer progression.

In this project, we aim to build machine learning models that predict cellular oxygenation status using single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Our dataset includes MCF7 and HCC1806  breast cancer cell lines, profiled using DropSeq and SmartSeq technologies.
